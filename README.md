This is my first django project in which i used and learned about python basics roles of django models, admin.py and settings.py, django apps and most importantly don't follow tuotrial blindly and take time to make a gitignore file :)
Once logged in, user can add blog and edit it and delete it.
And lastly how to deploy the website using pythonanywhere.com
